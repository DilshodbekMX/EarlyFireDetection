# EarlyFireDetection
The Early Fire Detection Project consists of 3 different mini projects:
1. Web site: For showing statistics
2. Desktop app for fully controlling cameras added by admins or Fire Fighters
3. App installed to rasberryPi: For detecting Fire and Smoke and sending notification to the nearest Fire Station (fire_detection.py (completing soon) file is responsible for detection and notification)
